### Week 2 – Assignments

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Each group will search for <b>two reference papers</b> in Earth Observation (EO) for each of the following machine learning areas:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</li>
  <li>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers</li>
  <li>Generative Neural Networks (GNNs)</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Select papers that cover a variety of fields — for example, using different EO sensors or addressing different applications.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Each group will prepare a short report summarizing the key findings from the selected papers.  
The report should conclude with a section on <b>future trends</b>, discussing current research directions and emerging topics in AI for Earth Observation (AI4EO).
</p>

<p><b>Deadline:</b> To be decided during the lesson.</p>
