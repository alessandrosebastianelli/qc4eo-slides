## What is quantum computing?

<div>
<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0"><b>Quantum Computing</b> is a type of computations whose <b>operations</b> harness the laws of quantum mechanics, to <b>solve problems too complex</b> for classical computers.</p>
<br>
<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1"><b>For some problems, supercomputers are not that super.</b> When classical computers fail, it is often due to complexity (problems with lots of variables interacting in complicated ways).</p>
<br>
<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">Any computational problem that can be solved by a classical computer can also be solved by a quantum computer (QC). Conversely, <b>any problem that can be solved by a QC can also be solved by a classical computer, at least in principle given enough time.</b></p>

## How to add a new presentation?

To add a new presentation called `{my_presentation}`

- create `{my_presentation}.md` in the main directory
  - by copying `getting_started.md`
  - and adjust the configuration
- create a folder `slides/{my_presentation}/_posts`
- add your markdown files in this folder

---

## How to create slides? (1/3)

- create a markdown file for each section/chapter/ ...
  - you can choose this freely (also all slides in one file is possible)
  - new files are needed for references, i.e. jumping to different sections
- each markdown file should start with `0000-1-1-` and is followed by its name to make referencing possible
- e.g. `0000-1-1-00_Overview.md`, where `00_Overview` is the file name
  - to refer to the slides in this file link to `#/00_Overview`
  - if you do not use the prefix `0000-1-1-` you can references files by using their full name without the file ending `.md`
- slides are shown in the alphabetical order of their file names

---

## How to create slides? (2/3)

- the content of the slides is written in simple markdown
- slides within a markdown file need to be separated by three `-`
- e.g.

  ```markdown
  ## Slide 1

  Text on slide 1

  -&nbsp;-&nbsp;-

  ## Slide 2

  - List on slide 2
  ```

  - note that you need to remove the space between the `-` to make it work

- the best way is to check these [slides on Github]({{site.githuburl}}/tree/gh-pages/slides/getting_started/_posts)

---

## How to create slides? (3/3)

If you want to use assets, such as images

- create a folder `assets/slides/{my_presentation}`
- use `{&nbsp;{ asset_folder }&nbsp;}` to reference to the file location
  - e.g. if you want to add and image from that folder
  ```html
  <img src="{&nbsp;{asset_folder}&nbsp;}/latex_marker.JPG" />
  ```
  - note that the spaces are not necessary
