## Contents

### Week 9: Machine Learning Meets Quantum
• Four intersections: CC, QC, CQ, QQ.
• Focus on CQ: classical data on quantum devices.
• Toy examples of QML.

### Week 10: Quantum Kernels & EO Applications
• Quantum kernel methods.
• Support Vector Machines with quantum kernels.
• EO case: hyperspectral pixel classification.

### Week 11: Variational Quantum Classifiers
• Hybrid quantum–classical training.
• Cost functions & optimization challenges.
• EO case: cloud detection, vegetation monitoring.

### Week 12: Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)
• Architecture & training.
• Barren plateaus and mitigation.
• EO case: crop type classification.

### Week 13: Quantum Generative Models
• Quantum Boltzmann Machines, Quantum GANs.
• Generative models for EO: data augmentation, anomaly detection.
• EO case: rare-event synthesis (floods, fires).
