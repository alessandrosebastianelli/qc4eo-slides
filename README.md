# QC4EO Slides

## Repository organization

This repository contains both slides and coding material.

### Coding

This section will appear soon.

### Slides

Slides are organized in 5 moduels. Each module has several slides that can be navigated both horizontally and vertically. Typically a horizontal movement represents a shift to a new topic, while a vetical movement represents a deep dive to a specific topic.

To easiest way of saving the slides to *.pdf* is to print the web page. Guidelines for chrome (other browsers are supported, but instructions might be different):

1. right click on the web page
2. click on print
3. set the following:
    - Destination -> Save as PDF
    - Pages -> All
    - Layout -> Landscape
4. click on save
